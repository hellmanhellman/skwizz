Reddit Skwisgaarifyer 1.2 for Chrome

Changes a few words around reddit. **Feel free to suggest more changes!** You dildo.

Firefox version [here](https://github.com/hellmanhellman/skwizz-firefox).


WHAT IT DOES:
Throws a dice for every text-element on the (reddit) page, and with 10% chance does the following to the text node.

* is/am -> ams
* friend -> pal
* that -> thats
* cool -> brutal
* TIL -> Todays I have learneds

It then pluralizes 40% of some of the words.
Then it throws a dice again, and with 10% chance, if the node ends with a period, it adds " Well, I guess THATS DOABLE." afterwards (ie this has less than 1% chance of happening).
